      <blockquote><p>Hollie Bowden<br>is a beauty fundamentalist,<br>a visionary designer and an aesthete.</p></blockquote><p>After completing her training at KLC School of Design in Chelsea, Hollie worked for a time with a number of interior design firms and architectural companies before establishing her own studio in Shoreditch in 2013. Now a company of eight, Hollie's projects extend internationally from the Ibizan countryside to the Hollywood hills for both residential and commercial clients. Her style offers a natural vocabulary of wit and intrigue and her work is renowned for its story telling.
      </p><blockquote><p>"I am completely intuitive with my approach and love the conceptual journey one goes through during a project giving space for the transformation of ideas. For me it is an organic process."
      </p></blockquote><p>Hollie’s aesthetics respond directly to their environment and she has a solid command on seamlessly integrating found and indigenous medium with contemporary comfort and unexpected grandeur.
      </p><p>Whilst each project is ultimately taste-driven, they evolve from strategic thinking and practical application. Hollie’s approach is both empathetic and perceptive in method and she works to inspire her clients whilst exceeding expectations.
      </p><p>Hollie has both the expertise and the experience to offer services from project consultation to space planning to full renovations, whilst her curatorial dexterity delivers in detail.
      </p><blockquote><p>“I am drawn to natural pieces and finishes and artisan craftsmanship, I believe deeply in the integration of old and new, creating a timelessness. Taking into consideration the context and architectural history of a project is essential for my design process. I am forever sourcing antiques and have an eye for extraordinary pieces that might otherwise go unseen or unloved. Moreover, I see myself as a curator of spaces, as much as I do an interior designer.”</p></blockquote>
